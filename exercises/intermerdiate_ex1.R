# Intermediate R - recap exercise 


# 1. generate a vector 'rn' with 10 random values 
#    drawn from a normal distribution
#    hint: use rnorm() with mean = 0 and sd  = 1


# 2. create a function 'rollDice' 
#    that takes as an argument 'n' 
#    and that outputs n random integers between 1-6


# 3. 'roll the dice' 10 times
#    store the results in a vector rd


# 4. combine rn and rd into a data frame, called 'dat'


# 5. compute the mean of each column and the median of each row


# 6. replace all values > 3 in the rd column with a value of 3


# 7. replicate steps 1-6 1000 times, 
#   at each iteration, compute the sum of the dataframe
#   store the resulting value in a vector if it is larger than 25
#   otherwise store an NA value


# 8. how many NA's have been generated?
